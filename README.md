Thaumcraft Addon for those that still crave more content 

Basically just more stuff to add to Thaumcraft. I've been working on this since 1.6.4, finally feel comfortable with doing a beta release ^^
Warning: This is built with a TC beta version not available to the public yet. So even if you download and compile, you probably wont be able to run it.
